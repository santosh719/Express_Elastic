          <h4> Summary </h4>
          <ul>
            <b>Collection of Data</b>
            <li> Implemented Crawler in Python using Beautiful soup, recursively traversing all the links from the main
              page
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Collected the output in different JSON files with title and content as keys.</li>
            <br>
            <b>Indexing the Content</b>
            <li> For indexing, loaded the data in Elasticsearch, it uses Apache Lucene as underlying implementation for
              indexing
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Insert all the JSON files as bulk input with the index mapping done using parameters BM25 and english
              analyzer.
            </li>
            <br><b>Web app</b>
            <li>
              You will find the list of 10 posts below with their respective recommendations which are queried from
              Elasticsearch. The AJAX recommendation API is implemented in Express.
            </li>
            <br>
            <h4>Originality</h4>
            <li> The interactive and response UI is developed in Materialize framework. Made use of the
              collapsible(accordion) element from it.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Using nltk library in python I have tokenized words, performed stemming, removed repeating
              words and characters, and extracted nouns using Regex, extracted leaves from
              each generated trees as list of meaningful words which is later used in data.js file.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Performed indexing in Elasticsearch using similarity algorithm BM25,
              also applied the english analyzer in index mapping while building of indices.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> BM25 Algorithm: In information retrieval, BM25 (BM stands for Best Matching) is a ranking function used
              by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query (term
              frequency). It uses probablistic approach.

            presented with this question in an end of module open book exam today and found myself lost. i was reading
            Head first Javaand both definitions seemed to be exactly the same. i was just wondering what the MAIN
            difference was for my own piece of mind. i know there are a number of similar questions to this but, none i
            have seen which provide a definitive answer.Thanks, Darren</p></div>

            <p><i class="tiny material-icons">library_books</i> <b>Question 2</b> Inheritance is when a 'class' derives
              from an existing 'class'.So if you have a Person class, then you have a Student class that extends Person,
              Student inherits all the things that Person has.There are some details around the access modifiers you put
              on the fields/methods in Person, but that's the basic idea.For example, if you have a private field on
              Person, Student won't see it because its private, and private fields are not visible to
              subclasses.Polymorphism deals with how the program decides which methods it should use, depending on what
              type of thing it has.If you have a Person, which has a read method, and you have a Student which extends
              Person, which has its own implementation of read, which method gets called is determined for you by the
              runtime, depending if you have a Person or a Student.It gets a bit tricky, but if you do something
              likePerson p = new Student();p.read();the read method on Student gets called.Thats the polymorphism in
              action.You can do that assignment because a Student is a Person, but the runtime is smart enough to know
              that the actual type of p is Student.Note that details differ among languages.You can do inheritance in
              javascript for example, but its completely different than the way it works in Java.</p>

            <p><i class="material-icons">library_books</i> <b>Question 3</b> Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects
              of different types in a similar manner.Example: Giraffe and Crocodile are both Animals, and animals can
              Move.If you have an instance of an Animal then you can call Move without knowing or caring what type of
              animal it is.Inheritance: This is one way of achieving both Polymorphism and code reuse at the same
              time.Other forms of polymorphism:There are other way of achieving polymorphism, such as interfaces, which
              provide only polymorphism but no code reuse (sometimes the code is quite different, such as Move for a
              Snake would be quite different from Move for a Dog, in which case an Interface would be the better
              polymorphic choice in this case.In other dynamic languages polymorphism can be achieved with Duck Typing,
              which is the classes don't even need to share the same base class or interface, they just need a method
              with the same name.Or even more dynamic like Javascript, you don't even need classes at all, just an
              object with the same method name can be used polymorphically.</p>
