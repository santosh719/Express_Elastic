  "content": "Tools exist to aid the migration of existing projects from C to Java. In general, automated translator tools fall into one of two distinct kinds:One kind converts C code to Java byte code. It is basically a compiler that creates byte code. It has the same steps as any other C compiler. See also C to Java JVM compilers.\nThe other kind translates C code to Java source code. This type is more complicated and uses various syntax rules to create readable Java source code. This option is best for those who want to move their C code to Java and stay in Java."
