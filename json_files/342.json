  "content": "Exactly as the name sounds, an @Inherited annotation type is inherited by subclasses of an annotated type.Code listing 1.2: Use of @Inherited\n\n\n@Inherited\n@interface ForEveryone { }\n\n@interface JustForMe { }\n\n@ForEveryone\n@JustForMe\nclass Superclass { }\n\nclass Subclass extends Superclass { }In this example, Superclass has been explicitly annotated with both @ForEveryone and @JustForMe. Subclass hasn't been explicitly marked with either one; however, it inherits @ForEveryone because the latter is annotated with @Inherited. @JustForMe isn't annotated, so it isn't inherited by Subclass."
