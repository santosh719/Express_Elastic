  "content": "char is a keyword. It defines a character primitive type. char can be created from character literals and numeric representation. Character literals consist of a single quote character (') (ASCII 39, hex 0x27), a single character, and a close quote ('), such as 'w'. Instead of a character, you can also use unicode escape sequences, but there must be exactly one.Syntax:char variable name1 = 'character1';Code section 1: Three examples.\n\n\n1 char oneChar1 = 'A';\n2 char oneChar2 = 65;\n3 char oneChar3 = '\\u0041';\n4 System.out.println(oneChar1);\n5 System.out.println(oneChar2);\n6 System.out.println(oneChar3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput for Code section 1\n\nA\nA\nA65 is the numeric representation of character 'A' , or its ASCII code.The nominal wrapper class is the java.lang.Character class when you need to store a char value but an object reference is required.Code section 2: char wrapping.\n\n\n1 char aCharPrimitiveType = 'A';\n2 Character aCharacterObject = aCharPrimitiveType;See also:Java Programming/Primitive Types"
