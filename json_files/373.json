  "content": "Code listing 9.1 shows the simplicity and power of the syntax for enabling the graphics functions within Java. Lets begin by understanding what a Canvas class does. A Canvas class is a derivative or a sub-class of the Component class and when placed over a Frame, displays as a blank area.For the purpose of drawing graphics, you may use any other class derived from the Component class, for instance, JPanel or even JTextField or JButton. Why we use the Canvas class is purely to grasp the idea of drawing in Java.Let us refine the above code for the class to be executable and the Canvas to be displayed. For this we will add an entry-point method namely the main(String[]) method in its body and calling a JFrame class to load the canvas on.Code listing 9.2: Displaying a Canvas class atop a JFrame\n\n\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\n\npublic class MyCanvas extends Canvas {\n    public MyCanvas() {\n    }\n\n    public void paint(Graphics graphics) {\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // We initialize our class here\n        MyCanvas canvas = new MyCanvas();\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame();\n        frame.setSize(400, 400);\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        // Here we add it to the frame\n        frame.getContentPane().add(canvas);\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n    }\n}The following code now helps our class to be executable and displays the canvas on top of the frame as it displays. Running this class would result in an empty frame, however it should be clear that the canvas is sitting atop it and is merely not displaying any drawings yet.Figure 9.1: A blank canvas atop a JFrame"
