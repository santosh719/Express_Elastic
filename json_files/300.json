  "content": "It can be said that the execution order of the threads was manipulated to some degree using the Thread.sleep(...) method. The Thread class has such static methods that can arguably affect the execution order and manipulation of threads. Below are some useful static methods in the Thread class. These methods when called will only affect the currently running threads.Method\nDescription\n\n\nThread.currentThread()\nReturns the currently executing thread at any given time.\n\n\nThread.dumpStack()\nPrints a stack trace of the currently running thread.\n\n\nThread.sleep(long millis)\nHalts execution of the currently running thread for the given amount of time (in milliseconds).\nthrows InterruptedException\n\n\nThread.sleep(long millis, int nanos)\nHalts execution of the currently running thread for the given amount of time (in milliseconds plus provided nanoseconds).\nthrows InterruptedException\n\n\nThread.yield()\nTemporarily pauses the execution of the currently running thread to allow other threads to execute."
