  "content": "To follow these standards, the bean needs one or more properties abstractions which represent different state values of an object. A property has a name (a valid Java identifier) and a type (either a reference type, a primitive type or an array type). By default, the properties of a JavaBean class are inferred by the presence of either a getter method, a setter method, or both:A getter method which is used to obtain the value of the property from a bean. The name is usually of the form getPropertyName. For example, the getter method for the String property whiskey is public String getWhiskey(). For boolean properties (those whose type is boolean, the convention is to use the naming pattern isPropertyName.isDiscounted() would be the getter method for a boolean property named discounted. Thus, the method signature of most getters is public PropertyType getPropertyName() or public boolean isPropertyName().A setter method which is used to assign a value to a bean's property. A setter method is a method of the form public void setPropertyName(PropertyType value). For the previous example, the setter could be invoked as setWhiskey(\"bourbon\");.As per the JavaBeans standard, getters and setters defined as described above automatically determine the properties of the class. However, by creating java.beans.PropertyDescriptor classes, you can specify alternate implementations by explicitly declaring the property names and the getter and/or setter methods for each property.Properties are often implemented with private instance variables, but this is not required."
