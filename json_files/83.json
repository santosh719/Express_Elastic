Think of a computer's memory as a table of data  where each cell corresponds to a variable.Upon creating a variable, we basically create a new address space and give it a unique name. Java goes one step further and lets you define what you can place within the variable  in Java parlance you call this a data type. So, you essentially have to do two things in order to create a variable:Create a variable by giving it a unique name; and,\nDefine a data type for the variable.The following code demonstrates how a simple variable can be created. This process is known as variable declaration.Code section 3.40: A simple variable declaration.\n\n\n1 int a;"
