Throughout the chapter, we tackled a variety of concepts that included:Objects and class definitions;\nAbstract and data types;\nProperties;\nMethods;\nClass-level and method-level scopes;\nKeywords; and,\nAccess modifiers, etc.From this point on, we will be looking into the above mentioned concepts and many more in finer detail with a deeper and richer understanding of how each one of them works. This chapter on Language fundamentals introduces the fundamental elements of the Java programming language in detail. The discussions in this chapter will use the concepts we have already gathered from our previous discussions and build upon them in a progressive manner."
