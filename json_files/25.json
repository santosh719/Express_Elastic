  "content": "We conceptualize the world around us in terms of systems. A system is a web of interconnected objects working together in tandem. In the systems theory, a system is set out as a single entity within a world surrounded by an environment. A system interacts with its surrounding environment using messages of two distinct types:inputs: messages received from the surrounding environment; and,\noutputs: messages given back to the surrounding environment.Figure 1: A simple system interacting with its environment using input and output messages.Life is a complicated mess of interconnected objects sending signals and messages. See the illustration below in figure 2 demonstrating a complex system for an economic ecosphere for a single company. Imagine what this system diagram would be like if you were to add a few more companies and their sub-systems. Computer software systems in general are a complex web of further interconnected sub-systems  where each sub-systems may or may not be divided into further sub-systems. Each sub-system communicates with others using feedback messages  that is, inputs and outputs.Figure 2: Example of a complex system with multiple sub-systems and interactions"
