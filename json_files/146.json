  "content": "The language distinguishes between bytes and characters. Characters are stored internally using UCS-2, although as of J2SE 5.0, the language also supports using UTF-16 and its surrogates. Java program source may therefore contain any Unicode character.The following is thus perfectly valid Java code; it contains Chinese characters in the class and variable names as well as in a string literal:Code listing 3.50: .java\n\n\n1 public class  {\n2     private String  = \"\";\n3 }"
