  "title": "The super keyword[edit]",
  "content": "The super keyword allows access to the members of the superclass of a class, as you can use this to access the members of the current class. Example:Code listing 4.11: Plane.java\n\n\n1 public class Plane extends Vehicle {\n2     public Plane() {\n3         super();\n4     }\n5 }In this example, the constructor of the Plane class calls the constructor of its superclass Vehicle. You can only use super to access the members of the superclass inside the child class. If you use it from another class, it accesses the superclass of the other class. This keyword also allows you to explicitly access the members of the superclass, for instance, in the case where there is a method with the same name in your class (overriding, ...). Example:Code listing 4.12: Vehicle.java\n\n\n1 public class Vehicle {\n2     // ...\n3     public void run() throws Exception {\n4         position += speed;\n5     }\n6 }Code listing 4.13: Plane.java\n\n\n 1 public class Plane extends Vehicle {\n 2     // ...\n 3     public void run() throws Exception {\n 4         if (0 < height) {\n 5            throw new Exception(\"A plane can't run in flight.\");\n 6         } else {\n 7            super.run();\n 8         }\n 9     }\n10 }Test your knowledge\n\nQuestion 4.1: Consider the following classes.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.1: Class1.java\n\n\n1 public class Class1 {\n2     public static final int CONSTANT_OF_CLASS_1 = 9;\n3     public int myAttributeOfClass1 = 40;\n4     public void myMethodOfClass1(int i) {\n5     }\n6 }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.1: Class2.java\n\n\n1 public class Class2 extends Class1 {\n2     public int myAttributeOfClass2 = 10;\n3     public void myMethodOfClass2(int i) {\n4     }\n5 }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.1: Class3.java\n\n\n1 public class Class3 {\n2     public static final int CONSTANT_OF_CLASS_3 = 9;\n3     public void myMethodOfClass3(int i) {\n4     }\n5 }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.1: Question1.java\n\n\n1 public class Question1 extends Class2 {\n2     public static final int CONSTANT = 2;\n3     public int myAttribute = 20;\n4     public void myMethod(int i) {\n5     }\n6 }\n\n\n\n\nList all the attributes and methods that can be accessed in the class Question1.\n\nAnswer\n\n\nCONSTANT_OF_CLASS_1\nmyAttributeOfClass1\nmyMethodOfClass1(int)\nmyAttributeOfClass2\nmyMethodOfClass2(int)\nCONSTANT\nmyAttribute\nmyMethod(int)\n\nQuestion1 inherits from Class1 and Class2 but not from Class3.See also the Object Oriented Programming book about the inheritance concept."
