  "content": "By now, the work on Oak had been significant but come the year 1993, people saw the demise of set-top boxes, interactive TV and the PDAs. A failure that completely ushered the inventors' thoughts to be reinvented. Only a miracle could make the project a success now. And such a miracle awaited anticipation.National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) had just unveiled its new commercial web browser for the internet the previous year. The focus of the team, now diverted towards where they thought the \"next-wave\" of computing would be  the internet. The team then divulged into the realms of creating the same embeddable technology to be used in the web browser space calling it an applet  a small application. Keeping all of this in mind, the team created a list of features tackling the C++ problems. In their opinion, the project should.....be simple and gather tested fundamentals and features from the earlier languages in it,\n..have standard sets of APIs with basic and advanced features bundled with the language,\n..get rid of concepts requiring direct manipulation of hardware (in this case, memory) to make the language safe,\n..be platform independent and may written for every platform once (giving birth to the WORA idiom),\n..be able to manipulate network programming out-of-the-box,\n..be embeddable in web browsers, and...\n..have the ability for a single program to multi-task and do multiple things at the same time.The team now needed a proper identity and they decided on naming the new technology they created Java ushering a new generation of products for the internet boom. A by-product of the project was a cartoon named \"Duke\" created by Joe Parlang which became its identity then.Finally at the SunWorldTM conference, Andreesen unveiled the new technology to the masses. Riding along with the explosion of interest and publicity in the Internet, Java quickly received widespread recognition and expectations grew for it to become the dominant software for browser and consumer applications.[2]Initially Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, but later it was released to open source; the term Java was a trademark of Sun Microsystems. Sun released the source code for its HotSpot Virtual Machine and compiler in November 2006, and most of the source code of the class library in May 2007. Some parts were missing because they were owned by third parties, not by Sun Microsystems. The released parts were published under the terms of the GNU General Public License, a free software license."
