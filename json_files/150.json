  "content": "Be aware that Java still interprets Unicode sequences within comments. For example, the Unicode sequence \\u002a\\u002f (whose codepoints correspond to */) is processed early in the Java compiler's lexical scanning of the source file, even before comments are processed, so this is a valid star-slash comment in Java:Code section 3.110: Unicode sequence interruption.\n\n\n1 /* This is a comment. \\u002a\\u002f\n2 String statement = \"This is not a comment.\";and is lexically equivalent toCode section 3.111: Unicode sequence interruption effect.\n\n\n1 /* This is a comment. */\n2 String statement = \"This is not a comment.\";(The '*' character is Unicode 002A and the '/' character is Unicode 002F.)Similar caveats apply to newline characters in slash-slash comments.For example:Code section 3.112: New line.\n\n\n1 // This is a single line comment \\u000a This is codeThat is because \\u000a is Unicode for a new line, making the compiler think that you have added a new line when you haven't."
