  "content": "At times, you would like to re-iterate a loop without executing the remaining statement within the loop. The continue statement causes the loop to re-iterate and start over from the top most statement inside the loop.Where there is an ability to re-iterate the loop, there is an ability to exit the loop when required. At any given moment, if you'd like to exit a loop and end all further work within the loop, the break ought to be used.The continue and break statements can be used with a label like follows:Code section 3.19: Using a label.\n\n\n1 String s = \"A test string for the switch!\\nLine two of test string...\";\n2 outer: for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n3   switch (s.charAt(i)) {\n4     case '\\n': break outer;\n5     case ' ': break;\n6     default: System.out.print(s.charAt(i));\n7   }\n8 }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput for code listing 3.19\n\n Ateststringfortheswitch!"
