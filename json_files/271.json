  "content": "Sometimes we may want to change the ordering of a collection of objects from the same class. We may want to order descending or ascending order. We may want to sort by name or by address.We need to create a class for each way of ordering. It has to implement the Comparator interface.Since Java 5.0, the Comparator interface is generic; that means when you implement it, you can specify what type of objects your comparator can compare.Code listing 5.7: CustomerComparator.java\n\n\n1 public class CustomerComparator implements Comparator<Customer> {\n2     public int compare(Customer cust1, Customer cust2) {\n3         return cust1.getName().compareTo(cust2.getName());\n4     }\n5 }The above class then can be associated with a SortedSet or other collections that support sorting.Code section 5.21: Comparator usage.\n\n\n1 Collection<Customer> orderedCustomers = new TreeSet<Customer>(new CustomerComparator());Using the Iterator the orderedCustomers collection can be iterated in order of sorted by name.A List can be sorted by the Collections' sort method.Code section 5.22: Customized comparison.\n\n\n1 java.util.Collections.sort(custList, new CustomerComparator());Sorts the specified list according to the order induced by the specified comparator. All elements in the list must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator.An array of objects can also be sorted with the help of a Comparator.Code section 5.23: Array sorting.\n\n\n1 SortableCustomer[] customerArray;\n2 //...\n3 java.util.Arrays.sort(customerArray, new CustomerComparator());Sorts the specified array of Customer objects (customerArray) according to the order induced by the specified comparator. All elements in the array must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator."
