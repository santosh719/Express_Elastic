  "content": "The two things you must at least create is an HTML page and a Java class. It can be done on a local folder, no need to run a server but it will be harder to understand what is local, what is remote. The HTML page has to call the Java class using the <applet/> markup:Code listing 9.3: HelloWorld.html\n\n\n1 <!DOCTYPE html>\n2 <html>\n3   <body>\n4     HTML content before the applet.<applet code=\"HelloWorld\" height=\"40\" width=\"200\"></applet>HTML content after the applet.\n5   </body>\n6 </html>Save this file on a folder. As the <applet/> markup is calling a Java class called HelloWorld, our class should be called HelloWorld.java:Code listing 9.4: HelloWorld.java\n\n\n 1 import java.applet.Applet;\n 2 import java.awt.Graphics;\n 3 \n 4 public class HelloWorld extends Applet {\n 5 \n 6     /**\n 7      * Print a message on the screen.\n 8      */\n 9     public void paint(Graphics g) {\n10         g.drawString(\"Hello, world!\", 20, 10);\n11     }\n12 }Save this file and compile the class on the same folder. Now let's open the web page on a browser:Figure 9.8: Java applet HelloWorld.We clearly see that \"Hello, world!\" is not rendered the same way as the rest of the page."
