  "content": "Applets are not constructed in the same way as other classes or main programs. The entry point is different and the main class should extend the Applet class. The Applet class has four methods that can be called by the browser and you can redefine:init()\nCalled when the browser first loads the applet. It is only called once by browser execution.\n\n\nstart()\nCalled when the applet starts running. It is called as many times as the user visits the web page.\n\n\nstop()\nCalled when the applet stops running. It is called as many times as the user visits the web page.\n\n\ndestroy()\nCalled when the user quits the browser. It is only called once by browser execution.\n\n\npaint()\nCalled when the applet needs to be rendered, for example, when the browser is resized.The four first methods define the lifecycle of an applet. At least init() or paint() must be redefined. The HTML applet tag can be embedded in the applet source code to allow the applet to be run directly by a simple applet viewer, without the need for an .html file. Typically, the applet tag immediately follows the import statements. It must be enclosed by /* */ comments:Code section 9.10: MyApplet comment\n\n\n1  /*\n2  <applet code=\"MyApplet.class\"> </applet>\n3  */"
