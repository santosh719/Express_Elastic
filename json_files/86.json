  "content": "Although memory spaces have their own addresses  usually a hash number such as 0xCAD3, etc.  it is much easier to remember a variable's location in the memory if we can give it a recognizable name. Identifiers are the names we give to our variables. You can name your variable anything like aVariable, someVariable, age, someonesImportantData, etcetera. But notice: none of the names we described here has a space within it. Hence, it is pretty obvious that spaces aren't allowed in variable names. In fact, there are a lot of other things that are not allowed in variable names. The things that are allowed are:Characters A to Z and their lower-case counterparts a to z.\nNumbers 0 to 9. However, numbers should not come at the beginning of a variable's name.\nAnd finally, special characters that include only $ (dollar sign) and _ (underscore).Test your knowledge\n\nQuestion 3.6: Which of the ones below are proper variable identifiers?\n\nf_name\nlastname\nsomeones name\n$SomeoneElsesName\n7days\nTheAnswerIs42\n\n\nAnswer\n\nI can tell you that 3 and 5 are not the right way to do things around here, the rest are proper identifiers.Any valid variable names might be correct but they are not always what you should be naming your variables for a few reasons as listed below:The name of the variable should reflect the value within them.\nThe identifier should be named following the naming guidelines or conventions for doing so. We will explain that in a bit.\nThe identifier shouldn't be a nonsense name like lname, you should always name it properly: lastName is the best way of naming a variable."
