The platform does not just enable a user to run and develop a Java application, but also features a wide variety of tools that can help developers work efficiently with the Java programming language.The platform consists of two essential softwares:the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is needed to run Java applications and applets; and,\nthe Java Development Kit (JDK), which is needed to develop those Java applications and applets. If you have installed the JDK, you should know that it comes equipped with a JRE as well. So, for all the purposes of this book, you would only require the JDK.In this section, we will explore in further detail what these two software components of the Java platform do."
