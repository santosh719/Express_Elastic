  "content": "instanceof is a keyword.It checks if an object reference is an instance of a type, and returns a boolean value;The <object-reference> instanceof Object will return true for all non-null object references, since all Java objects are inherited from Object. instanceof will always return false if <object-reference> is null.Syntax:<object-reference> instanceof TypeNameFor example:class Fruit\n {\n  //...\t\n } \n class Apple extends Fruit\n {\n  //...\n }\n class Orange extends Fruit\n {\n  //...\n }\n public class Test \n {\n    public static void main(String[] args) \n    {\n       Collection<Object> coll = new ArrayList<Object>();\n \n       Apple app1 = new Apple();\n       Apple app2 = new Apple();\n       coll.add(app1);\n       coll.add(app2);\n \n       Orange or1 = new Orange();\n       Orange or2 = new Orange();\n       coll.add(or1);\n       coll.add(or2);\n \n       printColl(coll);\n    }\n \n    private static String printColl( Collection<?> coll )\n    {\n       for (Object obj : coll)\n       {\n          if ( obj instanceof Object )\n          {\n             System.out.print(\"It is a Java Object and\");\n          }\n          if ( obj instanceof Fruit )\n          {\n             System.out.print(\"It is a Fruit and\");\n          }\n          if ( obj instanceof Apple )\n          {\n             System.out.println(\"it is an Apple\");\n          } \n          if ( obj instanceof Orange )\n          {\n             System.out.println(\"it is an Orange\");\n          }\n       }\n    }\n }Run the program:java TestThe output:\"It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Apple\"\n\"It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Apple\"\n\"It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Orange\"\n\"It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Orange\"Note that the instanceof operator can also be applied to interfaces. For example, if the example above was enhanced with the interfaceinterface Edible \n{\n //...\n}and the classes modified such that they implemented this interfaceclass Orange extends Fruit implements Edible\n {\n  ...\n }we could ask if our object were edible.if ( obj instanceof Edible )\n {\n   System.out.println(\"it is edible\");\n }"
