  "content": "Lots of applets use buttons. There are only a few ways to have contact between the applet and the user, and the use of buttons is one of those ways. Buttons are created the same way as most other Java applet objects:Code section 9.9: Button creation\n\n\n1 Button submitButton = new Button(\"Submit\");When initializing a button, it is necessary to define what text will appear on that button in the given parameter. In this example, the button is initialized with the word \"Submit\" printed on it. Adding the button to the actual layout is done in the init() method, as described above.Code section 9.10: Button display\n\n\n1 public void init() {\n2    \n3     ...\n4    \n5     add(submitButton);\n6 }Allowing buttons to carry out tasks or utilize a user's input is a bit more complicated. These functions require an ActionListener, and will be discussed in ActionListener section."
