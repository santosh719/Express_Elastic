Labels are initialized and added to applet layouts in the same way as buttons. Also, like buttons, the text inside labels must be identified at initialization. If, however, the label will receive its text as the cause of a later function and should start off blank, no text should be placed between the quotation marks.Code section 9.11: Label display\n\n\n1 Label nameLabel = new Label(\"Name: \");\n2 \n3 ...\n4 \n5 public void init() {\n6     add(nameLabel);\n7 }"
