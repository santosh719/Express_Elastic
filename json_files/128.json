  "content": "If you are importing library packages and classes that reside in a .jar file, you must ensure that the file is in the current classpath (both at compile- and execution-time). Apart from this requirement, importing these packages and classes is the same as if they were in their full, expanded, directory structure.Javac[edit]For example, to compile and run a class from a project's top directory (that contains the two directories /source and /libraries) you could use the following command:Compilation\n\n$ javac -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass.javaAnd then to run it, similarly:Execution\n\n$ java -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClassThe above is simplified, and demands that MainClass be in the default package, or a package called source, which isn't very desirable.BlueJ[edit]With BlueJ just click on Tools, Preferences, Libraries, and add the .jar one by one."
