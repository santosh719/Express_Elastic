  "content": "Because we have provided a data type for the variable, we have a hint as to what the variable can and cannot hold. We know that int (integer) data type supports numbers that are either positive or negative integers. Therefore once a variable is created, we can provide it with any integer value using the following syntax. This process is called an assignment operation.Code section 3.41: Variable declaration and assignment operation (on different lines).\n\n\n1 int a;\n2 a = 10;Java provides programmers with a simpler way of combining both variable declaration and assignment operation in one line. Consider the following code:Code section 3.42: Variable declaration and assignment operation (on the same line).\n\n\n1 int a = 10;"
