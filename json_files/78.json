  "content": "Java has several operators that can be used to compare variables. For example, how would you tell if one variable has a greater value than another? The answer: use the \"greater-than\" operator.Here is a list of the comparative operators in Java:>: Greater than\n<: Less than\n>=: Greater than or equal to\n<=: Less than or equal to\n==: Equal to\n!=: Not equal toTo see how these operators are used, look at this example:Code section 3.37: Comparisons.\n\n\n1 int a = 5, b = 3;\n2 System.out.println(a > b); // Value is true because a is greater than b\n3 System.out.println(a == b); // Value is false because a does not equal b\n4 System.out.println(a != b); // Value is true because a does not equal b\n5 System.out.println(b <= a); // Value is true because b is less than a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput for code section 3.37\n\ntrue\nfalse\ntrue\ntrueComparative operators can be used on any primitive types (except boolean), but only the \"equals\" and \"does not equal\" operators work on objects. This is because the less-than/greater-than operators cannot be applied to objects, but the equivalency operators can.Specifically, the == and != operators test whether both variables point to the same object. Objects will be covered later in the tutorial, in the \"Classes, Objects, and Types\" module."
