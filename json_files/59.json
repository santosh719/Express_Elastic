As we have already discussed, a program is a set of instructions, which are tasks provided to a computer. These instructions are called statements in Java. Statements can be anything from a single line of code to a complex mathematical equation. Consider the following line:Code section 3.1: A simple assignment statement.\n\n\n1 int age = 24;This line is a simple instruction that tells the system to initialize a variable and set its value as 24. If the above statement was the only one in the program, it would look similar to this:Code listing 3.1: A statement in a simple class.\n\n\n1 public class MyProgram {\n2     public static void main(String[] args) {\n3         int age = 24;\n4     }\n5 }Java places its statements within a class declaration and, in the class declaration, the statements are usually placed in a method declaration, as above."
