RMI is the object oriented equivalent to RPC (Remote procedure call).The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system allows an object running in one Java Virtual Machine (VM) to invoke methods of an object running in another Java VM. RMI provides for remote communication between programs written in the Java programming language.RMI is only defined for use with the Java platform. If you need to call methods between different language environments, use CORBA. With CORBA a Java client can call a C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done."
